## Sharing  is Good

The best code is used by the best people.
The more code is shared, the more we all benefit from that work.

For code to be shared:

- It must be under version control.
- It must be unencumbered of  propitiatory licenses.
  Hence, you need an **open source license**. 
- It must be accessible for now and for all time in the future.
  Your code needs to be **mirrored** 
  in some long-term, cite-able, repository.
- It needs to be  trusted by the community. This means that it needs a good
  **test suite**.
- It needs to be effectively **documented**.

## Version Control.

Git. Enough  said. Just do it.

## Open Source Licenses

To add a license to your repo, add a  [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/timm/keys/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
file to the root of your repo.

Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definitionâ€” 
in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. 

There are many different kinds of license and there are [on-line tools](https://choosealicense.com)
to help you decide which one is right for you.

- Choose anything you like but be aware the 
  [more esoteric you get](http://www.wtfpl.net), the fewer people will use your code.
- In practice, most folks using the MIT license or (if you are worried
  about patent trolls) the Apache license. 
  - The former is preferred for lightweight projects while the latter 
    requires a lot of documentation. 
  - E.g. see how much work goes into the [Zehyphr release notes](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/releases/tag/zephyr-v2.5.0) 
    (and Zephyr uses the Apache license).


## Long Term Storage, Cite-able

Your repo needs a "digital object idenitifier" badge that assigns a unique ID
to your code _and_ which backs up a copy of the code to some long term storage. 
To check for that badge, look for something like:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4728990.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4728990)

This badge makes the code "cite-able".
Github repos are temporary, they  can be deleted. Developers need to
registered their repo at some long-term storage facility  like Zenodo. There:

- It you make a release in Github
- Zenodo will grab a zipped copy and store it on its
hard drives (somewhere in Switzerland) and issues you with a "DOI" (digital object
identifier) 

For notes on that process, see [here](http://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

## Unit Tests

Your repo needs a [.travis.yml](https://github.com/timm/keys/blob/main/.travis.yml)
that adds a "post-commit hook" to the  repo. This hook runs a test suite each time
the code is committed. This, in turn, updates a badge on your repo that  tells people
your code has  tests and those tests are working.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/timm/keys.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/timm/keys)

To code the test suite, you need something that runs and returns 
the shell flag _$?=0_ (if there 
are no errors) or _$?&gt;0_ (if errors were found). This is simple- just have a demo
suite that does some asserts. If those asserts fail, your code will crash  and set
_$?&gt;0_.

As to how to write the test suite, there are any number of unit test tools.
And its easy to write your own. For example, the  test suite here  is inside
[./src/eg.lua](https://github.com/timm/keys/blob/main/src/eg.lua). This code can be called in
three ways:

- `cd src; ./eg.lua` which just runs everything;
- `cd src; ./eg.lua ?` which lists all the  available tests;
- `cd src; ./eg.lua xxx` which runs just test `xxx`. This last call
  is very handy when writing and debugging just on example.

## Documentation

Code needs to be understood. It needs pretty prints that shows comments with the code.
There are  any number of tools for that purpose. Here:

- We create a directory `./docs` containing a file `./docs/.nojeykll`;
- Then we use the `pycco` took to fill up that directory with html files
  that describe the code.
- Then we tell Github to serve `./docs` as a website (see  
  see https://github.com/yourName/yourProject/settings/pages).
